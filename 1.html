                The HyperText Markup Language or HTML
            </a>
            is the
            <strong> <!-- Bold -->
                standard markup <u>language</u> <!-- Underline -->
            </strong>
            for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
            It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

            In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. <br> <!-- New line -->
            In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.
            Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.
            That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. <br>
            In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

        <p>
            The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. <br>
            It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.
            Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, <br>
            an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN.
            Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.
